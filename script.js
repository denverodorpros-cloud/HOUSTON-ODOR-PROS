  {
    "question": "What is ozone odor removal?",
    "answer": "Ozone odor removal uses O3 gas to react with odor molecules in air, fabrics, vents, and porous surfaces. It is designed to neutralize odors rather than mask them."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is ozone treatment safe for my family?",
    "answer": "The treated area must be unoccupied by people, pets, and plants during ozone treatment. After the process, the space is ventilated before normal use resumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does ozone treatment remove pet urine odor in Houston homes?",
    "answer": "It can help with pet odor in air, carpets, furniture, and room surfaces. Severe urine contamination may also require cleaning, pad replacement, sealing, or material removal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you remove smoke odor from an apartment?",
    "answer": "Yes. Smoke odor removal usually targets walls, ceilings, vents, fabrics, cabinets, and flooring after the smoke source and residue are addressed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you remove odors before move-in?",
    "answer": "Yes. We help prepare homes and rentals for move-in by assessing lingering pet, smoke, and other household odors. Use the Free Estimate form to share your property details and timeline."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can ozone help with cooking and food odors?",
    "answer": "Yes. Ozone treatment can help reduce lingering cooking, food, and stale indoor odors after trash, spills, residue, and odor sources are cleaned or removed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does ozone odor removal take?",
    "answer": "Many treatments take several hours, while larger or more severe jobs can require longer treatment and ventilation time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to leave my home during treatment?",
    "answer": "Yes. The treated area must remain empty during ozone treatment and until it has been properly ventilated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you treat cars and trucks?",
    "answer": "Yes. Vehicle odor removal can address smoke, pet, spill, food, stale, and resale odors in upholstery, carpets, vents, and trunks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much does odor removal cost in Houston?",
    "answer": "Cost depends on odor type, severity, square footage, access, and whether the job is a home, car, rental, or commercial space. HOUSTON ODOR PROS provides free estimates."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer same-day odor removal?",
    "answer": "Scheduling options are confirmed by address and availability depending on schedule and location. Call (713) 444-4742 to check availability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you serve cities outside Houston?",
    "answer": "Yes. HOUSTON ODOR PROS serves Houston and major cities within approximately 150–200 miles, including Greater Houston, Galveston, Beaumont, Brenham, Bryan–College Station, Huntsville, and Lufkin. Extended trips toward Austin and San Antonio are reviewed by address and availability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will ozone remove all odors permanently?",
    "answer": "Ozone can deliver strong results when the odor source is removed or controlled. If the source remains, such as active moisture or repeated pet accidents, odor may return."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is ozone odor removal good for real estate listings?",
    "answer": "Yes. Fresh-smelling homes can help buyers and renters focus on the property rather than odors from previous occupants, pets, smoke, or moisture."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can ozone treat HVAC odor?",
    "answer": "Ozone can move through air pathways, but HVAC odor may require filter changes, duct cleaning, or source correction depending on the cause."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you use fragrance?",
    "answer": "The goal is odor neutralization first. A light finishing scent may be used only when appropriate and requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I clean before ozone treatment?",
    "answer": "Basic source cleaning helps. Remove trash, soiled items, ash, pet waste, wet materials, and heavily contaminated belongings when possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you treat furnished homes?",
    "answer": "Yes, ozone can reach many fabrics and furnishings. Some delicate items, plants, and sensitive materials may need to be removed or protected."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you work with property managers and landlords?",
    "answer": "Yes. Rental turnover, apartment odor removal, move-out odor problems, and tenant-ready treatments are common service requests."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I request a free estimate?",
    "answer": "Call (713) 444-4742 or use the estimate form on the website. Include the city, odor source, space size, and timeline for the most useful reply."
